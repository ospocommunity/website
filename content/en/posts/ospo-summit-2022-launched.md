Our communication with international conferences has been interrupted for over 3 years due to the requirements of China's epidemic prevention policy. We urgently need an offline gathering to unite the open-source power of Chinese companies. We want to enable companies that rely on open source to share, learn, and summarize their experiences so that all parties can benefit, and especially practitioners can succeed.

Our summit is scheduled to be held in Beijing on December 16, and through a vote of the preparatory team, we have chosen Localization and Globalization as the theme.

China is special, whereas open source is global. We must perceive rationally, both to understand and implement according to the local situation, but also to integrate and influence the world.
