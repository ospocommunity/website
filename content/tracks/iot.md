Recent years, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications show the requirements about the embedded operation system, data collection from the side, data management both on the side and the cloud, and data analysis technologies.
The Apache Software Foundation provides many related projects, like [Apache IoTDB](https://iotdb.apache.org), [Apache Mynewt](https://mynewt.apache.org), [Apache PLC4X](https://plc4x.apache.org) and [Apache Streampipes](https://streampipes.apache.org) to meet users' requirements.

This track will introduce the recent progress, some core technologies and the use experience of IoT related Apache projects ([Call For Paper](https://acasia2021.jamhosted.net/)).
It will be a great feast for all users and developers who are interested in IoT/IIoT applications.
