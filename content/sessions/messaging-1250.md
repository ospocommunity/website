The OpenTelemetry ecosystem is mature for observability solutions and has amassed a certain number of users so far that the community has integrated Apache Pulsar into the OpenTelemetry ecosystem as part of its underlying support for observability. In actual observability scenarios, the huge data production rate and relatively slow data consumption rate at the data acquisition end are often the biggest problems that restrict data integrity. This talk will share how to use Apache Pulsar Receiver/Exporter as a buffer on the open-Telemetry - Collector platform to solve these problems.
