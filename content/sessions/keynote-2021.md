Students in higher education are a user group that cannot be ignored in the world of open source software and are the most expected to be converted into contributors. Modern open source development provides a scenario for large-scale collaboration and social programming, and students often face barriers such as language, time zone, and psychological unfamiliarity before stepping into it. This sharing will hopefully motivate, help and inspire college students who want to or are involved in open source through my personal experience and journey of being involved in open source communities during my graduate studies
