Apache Tomcat implements the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Pages, Jakarta Expression Language, Jakarta WebSocket and Jakarta Authentication specifications. Jakarta EE 8 and Jakarta EE 9 were transition releases that did not provide new features to end users. The recently released Jakarta EE 10 is the first release to include new features and other changes.

This session will look at the changes in Jakarta EE 10 for the specifications that Apache Tomact implements and what these changes mean for developers looking to deploying their on Apache Tomact 10.1.

Planning for Jakarta EE 11 is now starting so the second part of the session will look at the changes planned for Jakarta EE 11 and provide an opportunity for attendees to provide input into that planning process.
