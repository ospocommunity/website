The OpenTelemetry ecosystem provides relatively mature solutions among observability options, which already have a certain number of users. The community has integrated Apache Pulsar into the OpenTelemetry ecosystem as part of its underlying support solutions to observability. In production, a massive amount of data is produced while consumed at a relatively slow rate. This is often the biggest problem that impairs data integrity. In this speech, we will discuss using Apache Pulsar Receiver/Exporter as a buffer on OpenTelemetry Collector to solve the problem.
