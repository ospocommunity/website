DeepRec(PAI-TF) is a unified large-scale sparse model training/prediction engine of Alibaba Group, which is widely used in Taobao, Tmall, Ali Mama, Autaavi, Taobao, AliExpress, Lazada, etc., supporting taobao's core business of search, recommendation, advertising and so on. Super-large sparse training supported by billions of features and trillions of samples.

Online Deep Learning, based on DeepRec, Flink, Kafka and Flink-Aiflow, combines Online Learning with offline training to create an integrated Online and offline Learning framework. Based on cloud native architecture, it provides users with a complete solution from offline to Online. This talk will introduce a series of key technologies in ODL scenarios, including: super-sparse model training/prediction, second-level model thermal update, real-time training model correction, model rollback and sample playback, sample repair, real-time training elastic resource scheduling, etc.
