With the concept of cloud-native more impressive, the development method using a native way based on the cloud service we can call cloud-native architecture now become the critical way to reduce costs and increase efficiency. There is no hesitation in saying that traditional microservice architectures are being "baptized" by cloud-native technologies. Cloud-native gateway is one of the representative technologies. While ensuring the primary load balancing function, it can also rely on its cloud-native attributes to achieve tasks including but not limited to observability, authentication, etc. By explaining the architectural solution implementation of the cloud-native gateway, we can foresee the future API development trend.
