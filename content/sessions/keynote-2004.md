title: "Brand Management - An Introduction"
date: "" 
track: "keynote"
presenters: "Mark Thomas"
stype: "English Session"

This session is aimed primarily at committers of Apache projects. It will start with an overview of branding and trademarks and discuss how these relate to the project community and how they contribute to the
overall health of the project. The bulk of the session will cover the services that the Brand Management team provides to projects. These services cost the ASF between $60k and $80k each year and the dicussion of services will include typical costs.

Registration will look at the benefits of registering the project's marks, the registration process and how we choose which countries we apply to for registration. It will also look at the used by incoming projects to transfer any existing marks they may have to the ASF.

Using our marks will explain how we grant permission to use our marks as well as what we - generally - allow and don't allow. This may be of help to companies looking to build products based on Apache projects so that they can ensure that they use our marks correctly.

Managing potential infringements will describe the key things to do and not to do when addressing a potential infringment of a project mark so that the project has the best chance of resolving the issue with the
minimum of hassle for everyone concerned.
