title: "In this talk an extension of Apache Atlas’ data model and an alternative open source user interface is presented, which addresses non-technical users. In more detail, in this presentation the underlying extension of the data model is motivated and explained. Further, it is motivated which derived information is required by the business user to increase the usability. Next the open source backend functionality is explained and the underlying technologies are motivated. Finally, a short tutorial is provided on how to setup your own system with a related open source helm chart and explains how to get started."

Apache Atlas provides data governance functionality and is part of the Hadoop eco-system, however, it is not limited to it. The underlying data model is very generic and can be extended. This makes Apache Atlas very flexible, however, has consequences for the usability of the user interface.
In this talk an extension of the data model and an alternative open source user interface is presented, which can be used more intuitively by non-technical users, especially business users.
In more detail, in this presentation the underlying extension of the data model is motivated and explained. Further, it is motivated which derived information is required by the business user to increase the usability. Next the open source backend functionality is explained and the underlying technologies are motivated. Finally, a short tutorial is provided on how to setup your own system with a related open source helm chart and explains how to get started.
The motivation for this talk is to promote this open source project and find support and interest in the community.  
Some related numbers:
- we are adding 6 additional base types
- we have a further extension of these 6 types for elastic, kafka and kubernetes
- the frontend is in Angular
- the backend uses Apache Atlas, HBase, Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Keycloak, Apache Httpd, elasticsearch and elastic enterprise search
