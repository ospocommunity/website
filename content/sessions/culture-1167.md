What is commercially friendly? A betrayal of open source? Too much compromise with business? Can you go far? We asked people from law, venture capital, evangelists, and entrepreneurs to talk about open source and commercial-friendly:
1. License is the function of product, software license
2. What is commercial friendliness? How to read it
3. How far will Open Core go?
4. What are the advantages of open source projects under the Apache Software Foundation?
5. Risk identification of open source project commercialization
