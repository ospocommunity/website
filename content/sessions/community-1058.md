How to help the community to expand its influence and build a positive cycle of community ecology has always been a question for everyone to think about. For Jing and Reese, what they can do for Apache APISIX, as beginners and non-contributors to the open source community, is the biggest puzzle and inevitable consideration on the way of growth.
In the process of helping Apache APISIX build a community, Jing and Reese have stepped into many holes. For example: Where to draw the line between open source community and commercialization? How to coordinate conflicts of interest with third parties? What problems have YOU encountered on the way to do Summit/ Meetup? How activities between open source communities benefit "both sides"; How long the free face brush lasts and what we can do after it's done; How can APISIX communicate and collaborate with other open source communities in order to be more acceptable to them? Compared with other KPI-based open source business models, how do we do it: Avoid over-involvement of operations people in open source project collaboration, especially "over-embellishments"? In every activity, we should constantly grope and advance.
