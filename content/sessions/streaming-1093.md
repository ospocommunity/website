With the rise and application of data lake format, it is necessary to continuously explore and enrich how to better integrate with the existing big data ecology in the actual production environment and solve the difficulties under the current big data/data warehouse architecture. This topic explores how to combine Apache Hudi and Apache Spark to implement a CDC solution to build a complete streaming incremental data warehouse in the classic data warehouse CDC scenario.
