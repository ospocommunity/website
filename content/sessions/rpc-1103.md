For companies with cloud island business structure, the cloud platform belongs to the internal and fully controllable LAN of the company, while the island is an independent internal network with its own security network policy. When cloud island communication is required, some ports will be opened based on demand and according to customer requirements. This process requires a certain cost and is not completely controllable. In business, if this cross-network demand increases, it will gradually become a pain point. If you can build a transparent cross-network transmission network with a good top-level design, you can find a better balance between business support, security control and operation and maintenance costs. This talk will introduce the technical challenges faced by Zheng Caiyun in the implementation process of DuBBo-based cross-network solutions, community cooperation, and some thoughts on deeper abstractions. In the government-enterprise business scenario of the data cross-network, compared with the industry's public cloud and self-built private cloud companies, there are both commonalities and their own characteristics, hoping to provide new ideas or inspiration for everyone.
