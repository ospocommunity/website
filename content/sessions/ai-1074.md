OpenMLDB is an enterprise-grade feature platform that tackles the challenges of feature engineering for machine learning. It enables consistent features for offline training and online inference, and highlights the efficiency of real-time feature extraction. In this talk, we will first introduce the design methodology of OpenMLDB, which is built based on separate batch and real-time SQL engines. Then we will focus on the detailed architecture, especially (1) the optimization techniques for Spark to improve the efficiency of batch feature processing; and (2) the unified execution plan generator to inherently ensure the consistency between the batch and real-time SQL engines. Finally, we will demonstrate a few use cases for real-world machine learning applications based on OpenMLDB.
