The Release schedule for Apache Hive 4.0 has been on hold for a long time, but the community has not stopped developing and improving, and the patches that have been resolved and marked as Apache Hive 4.0 have accumulated to an order of magnitude.

However, not all Apache Hive users in China have a clear understanding of Apache Hive capabilities, and many people still stay in the Hive On MapReduce stage. In order to change this situation, I think it is necessary to re-introduce Apache Hive to the public and many new features of Apache Hive 4.0 to change the perception of Apache Hive and increase the communication between Apache Hive users and the community
