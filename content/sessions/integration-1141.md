Camel is the Swiss knife of integration, and the most famous integration project from ASF.
Camel offers more than 300 connectors, to transfer data to and from a wide variety of systems. The toolbox also brings options to route, filter and transform data based on the wildest requirements of a modern or legacy enterprise.

This session covers all the latest development of the Camel projects, and roadmaps of what is coming next. 

During the session we will show quick demos of Camel.
