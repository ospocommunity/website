As open-source culture continues to win hearts and minds, businesses and organizations increasingly recognize that open-source software is not just a technological asset but a key driver for innovation, collaboration, and building sustainable ecosystems. The Open Source Program Office (OSPO) plays an essential role in this wave, guiding organizations to smartly leverage open-source resources while ensuring participation and contribution to the open-source community in the best manner, adhering to relevant licenses and regulations.

The OSPO Summit aims to enlighten attendees on establishing or optimizing an OSPO, as well as enhancing organizational competitiveness through strategic management and participation in open-source projects. From policy formulation to community building, from compliance to cultural cultivation, we will explore how OSPO can become an indispensable part of corporate strategy, thereby unlocking the boundless potential of open source.
Founded in 2022, the inaugural OSPO Summit concluded successfully in March 2023 in Beijing, with the second conference planned for March 2024 in Shenzhen.
