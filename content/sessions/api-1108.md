It has been said that data are the new oil. The de facto standard is HTTP APIs to connect oil pipelines between heterogeneous systems, whether plain, RESTful or REST. But no company just exposes their information system to the outside.

You need a central unified entry-point to handle cross-cutting concerns: classic ones like authentication and IP blacklisting and API-related ones like rate limiting and canary release.

In this workshop, we will use Apache APISIX on Docker to show a couple of nifty features that can help your information system cope with the challenges introduced by APIs.

1. Routing your calls to the correct upstream
2. Available abstractions: Route, Upstream, Service
3. The Apache APISIX dashboard
4. Configuring APISIX with the dashboard
5. Configuring APISIX with the command-line
6. Monitoring APISIX
7. Low-code Plugin Orchestration
