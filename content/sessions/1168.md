S3A and ABFS cloud connectors are widely used by systems like Hive and Spark while running workloads in public clouds like S3 and Azure.
In this talk we want to talk about multiple enhancements in cloud storage (Aws and Azure) modules in Apache Hadoop like how the announcement of consistent S3 by AWS led to an end of the S3Guard era and the listing optimisations we did to make S3 listing faster and introduction of new api’s like open file and io statistics in hadoop and its support in S3A connector.
