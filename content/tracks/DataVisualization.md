In the era of Big Data, data visualization is an important tool to help users quickly understand and explore data. At Apache Software Foundation, we have excellent visualization projects such as Apache ECharts, Apache Superset, etc., which respond to the visualization needs in various scenarios.

The DataVisualization track will focus on data visualization in big data performance, interactive and animation, mobile optimization, cross-platform rendering and many other topics, and is dedicated to exploring more possibilities of data visualization.
