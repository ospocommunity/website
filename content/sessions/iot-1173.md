Apache IoTDB (Internet of Things Database) is a database management system software for managing massive data in the Internet of Things. It integrates data collection, storage, management and analysis functions. Timeseries data in the Internet of Things scenario has the characteristics of fast generation, large volume and high potential value. 

According to the characteristics of timeseries data, IoTDB uses an efficient compression function to help users reduce storage costs. Efficient query and storage engines are implemented to help users improve data service experience. IoTDB provides rich timeseries data analysis capabilities to help users mine value from data better. Apache IoTDB has a lightweight architecture with high performance and rich functions. It is deeply integrated with Apache Hadoop, Spark, and Flink to meet the requirements of massive data storage, high-speed data querying, and complex data analysis in the industrial Internet of Things. Apache IoTDB adheres to the concept of "openness brings win-win" to do open source, incubated in 2018 and graduated in 2020 to become Apache international top database software project.
