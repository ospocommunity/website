## Installation

**1. Install Hugo**

To use this theme you will first need to have Hugo installed. Please follow the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Check your Hugo version - **Hugo Extended** is required!

This theme uses [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/) to compile SCSS and minify assets which means if you not using the Hugo extended version this theme will not work. To check your version of Hugo, run  `hugo version`. Make sure you see __/extended__ after the version number, for example _Hugo Static Site Generator v0.82.0/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown_ You do not need to use version v0.82.0 specifically, it just needs to have the _/extended_ part.

**2. Create a new Hugo site**

This will create a fresh Hugo site in the folder `mynewsite`.

```
hugo new site mynewsite
```

**3. Install the theme**

Download or git clone this theme into the sites themes folder `mynewsite/themes`. You should end up with the following folder structure `mynewsite/themes/hugo-hero-theme`

```
cd mynewsite
git clone https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-hero-theme.git themes/hugo-hero-theme
```

**4. Copy the example content**

Copy the entire contents of the `mynewsite/themes/hugo-hero-theme/exampleSite/` folder to root folder of your Hugo site, ie `mynewsite/`. To copy the files using terminal, make sure you are still in the projects root, ie the `mynewsite` folder.

```
cp -a themes/hugo-hero-theme/exampleSite/. .
```

**5. Update config.toml**

After you copy the `config.toml` into the root folder of your Hugo site you will need to update the `baseURL`, `themesDir` and `theme` values in `mynewsite/config.toml`

```
baseURL = "/"
themesDir = "themes"
theme = "hugo-hero-theme"
```

**6. Run Hugo**

After installing the theme for the first time, generate the Hugo site.

You run this command from the root folder of your Hugo site ie `mynewsite/`

```
hugo
```

For local development run Hugo's built-in local server.

```
hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

## Configuring Theme

### Homepage meta tags

Often a homepage requires special meta tags such as a meta description or og meta data for twitter, facebook etc. You can configure these values in the `config.toml`

```
// config.toml
...

  [params.homepage_meta_tags]
    meta_description = "a description of your website."
    meta_og_title = "My Theme"
    meta_og_type = "website"
    meta_og_url = "https://www.mywebsite.com"
    meta_og_image = "https://www.mywebsite.com/images/tn.png"
    meta_og_description = "a description of your website."
    meta_twitter_card = "summary"
    meta_twitter_site = "@mytwitterhandle"
    meta_twitter_creator = "@mytwitterhandle"

```

### Set meta tags on a per layout basis

You can set meta tags on a per template basis using a block. For example, you might want to write a custom meta description for the `/services` page. You can insert any valid HTML meta data inside the `{{ define "meta_tags }}` block at the top of a template.

```
// layouts/services/list.html
...

{{ define "meta_tags" }}
    <meta name="description" content="We offer a variety of services in the finance industry" />
{{ end }}

{{ define main }}
...
```

### Google Analytics

Add your google analytics ID to the `config.toml`

```
// config.toml
[params]
  google_analytics_id="UA-132398315-1"
```

### Menu

You can edit and add main menu links in the `config.toml` under `[[menu.main]]`
