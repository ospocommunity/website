With the increasing focus on supply chain security, there is a greater demand for reproducible binary builds. This presents an opportunity for open source projects as, unlike closed source projects, reproducible binary builds enable open source projects to categorically demonstrate that the convenience binaries that they provide have been built from an tagged, unaltered source tree that end users are able to audit.

Over the past year, the Apache Tomcat project has been working towards cross-platform reproducible binary builds. Tomcat is now in the position where, from a given project tag, identical release distributions including source archives, binaries and authenticode signed installers for Windows can be generated on either Windows or Linux. This session will look at the challenges the Apache Tomcat project faced in moving to reproducible builds, the techniques used to debug differences between builds and the different solutions used to resolve them.
