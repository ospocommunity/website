Open-source communities and technologies bring powerful momentum to the development of various industries, as well as cultural and ideological changes for organizations, communities, and individuals exploring in open-source communities. In the open-source ecosystem, the roles of participants are different, and there are significant differences in the issues they pay attention to, the ways they participate, and the values they receive. This sharing will mainly focus on how individuals can view open-source communities and technologies, how to find personal ways to participate in open-source communities, and discover more interests, self-improvement, and gain new energy and value in career development.
