With the advent of the big data era, the application of data analysis and OLAP technology in enterprises is becoming more and more widespread. In order to promote communication and sharing in this field in the industry, we have set up the OLAP and Data Analysis Track. We hope to invite experts and scholars in the industry to share their research results, practical experience, and latest developments in data analysis and OLAP technology.

In ASF, there are various projects about OLAP and data analysis, for example: Apache Doris, Apache Druid, Apache Kylin, Apache Pinot, Apache Hawq etc.

The topic can cover research progress, application cases, best practices, performance optimization, and other aspects of data analysis and OLAP technology. We believe it will greatly bring great benefits to the attendees.
