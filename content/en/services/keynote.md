##  speech Abstract

> Open Source Program Offices serve many organizations to provide strategy and alignment for an organization's open source efforts and ensure open source >continuity in the long term. Managing open source in an organization is a broad, dynamic, and complex topic requiring a wide scope of skills, responsibilities, >and ways of working - making it hard to get a complete overview that can be shared with the wider organization or help you with managing your OSPO.

> This presentation shares a set of recommendations and best practices to build your minimum viable OSPO (MVO), and how to ensure it aligns with the organization's >processes, work environment, and structure. Also, this presentation provides a list of existing resources and tools from the TODO Group and sister open source >communities (e.g the OSPO Mind Map) to use to help implement an OSPO strategy.

>The audience will leave with a step-by-step MVO checklist to take you from idea to proposal, to better communicate the value of adopting a strategic posture around open source within your organization.
