Pulsar Function is a succinct computing abstraction Apache Pulsar provides to express simple ETL and streaming tasks. The simplicity comes in two folds: Simple Interface and Simple Deployment. As it has been adopted, we realized that the ability to run natively on the cloud and integrate multiple functions into one integrity are key to user success. We developed this new feature -- Function Mesh -- to support these new requirements.
This talk aims to provide a thorough walkthrough of this new Function Mesh Feature, including its design, implementation, use cases, and examples, to help people seeking simple streaming solutions understand this newly created powerful tool in Apache Pulsar.
