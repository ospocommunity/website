Cloud native development requires your microservices to have a small resource footprint and a fast startup. Classic Java (and Apache Camel) applications are not very well suited for Cloud Native. We'll learn how Camel K can leverage Quarkus Native build in order to transform transparently your application in a first class Cloud Native citizen. Thanks to the Kamelet technology and the recent development made in Camel K we'll see how this is possible and how the resulting application will be a memory reduced and faster version of the classic one.

Pasquale will show a demo illustrating various "operational" aspects that will let you understand how best operate a Camel K Quarkus native application running on Kubernetes.
