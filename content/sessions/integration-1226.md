Have you ever got the task to implement an exchange of data between two systems that were not designed to communicate with each other? I bet you have, and I dare to introduce a couple of tools and approaches making the task easier to accomplish.

First, I’ll speak about Apache Camel, the Swiss knife of integrating heterogeneous systems. It offers 300+ connectors out of the box, to transfer data to and from a wide variety of systems. The toolbox also brings options to route, filter and transform data based on the wildest requirements of a modern or legacy enterprise.

Second, I will show what fun it is to write Camel integrations on top of Quarkus. You’ll learn about the famous Quarkus dev mode - the background compilation & live reload of the application while coding for faster dev cycles. Further, I’ll talk about dev services - an automatic provisioning of a required external service, such as Kafka broker or a database when testing or developing. Bonus: Quarkus applications start in milliseconds and consume just a few tens of megabytes of RAM.

Third, I will explain how the outstanding integration capabilities of Apache Camel enrich serverless architectures based on Knative. I will touch topics like auto-scaling and scaling to zero, content based routing of cloud events, as well as streaming data between Apache Kafka and the 300+ kinds of systems supported by Apache Camel.
