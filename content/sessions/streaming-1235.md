The Streaming computing engine for Tencent's advertising business is gradually switching from Spark Streaming to Apache Flink. In this talk, we will cover our business scenarios in feature production, training samples, strategy calculation, and some of the challenges, experiences and lessons learned in Spark Streaming switching to Apache Flink. It includes some upgrade and optimization of Flink kernel under the scenario of massive data (40TB), so that it can meet the characteristics of abnormal fast recovery in the large state of 40TB, and stream as batch (not stream as one batch).
