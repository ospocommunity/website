As an important part of open source software, open source license is an important part of copyleft movement and also plays an important role in the current open source software ecosystem. Whether it's the famous Google vs Oracle Java source wars or more recently SFC vs Vizio. Open source licenses are becoming increasingly important in the software supply chain. For this reason, SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) has adopted 2.2.1 as an ISO standard after ten years of development. Against this backdrop, it is now essential for every software engineer to learn about open source licenses and how to choose one for his own open source project, or what to look out for when using someone else's project.
