Please pay attention to the latest visa policy of China:
1. 144-Hour Visa-Free Transit Policy
China has resumed the 144-hour visa-free transit policy, which allows people from certain countries to enjoy six days of travel to select areas of the country without applying for a visa beforehand. 
   - To obtain this visa exemption, the foreign national must have a valid passport from one of the 53 countries, which includes: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia, United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Monaco, Belarus, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar.
   - As per the requirements of China’s National Immigration Authority (NIA), people applying for 144-hour visa-free transit must have:
     - A valid passport or another international travel document that is valid for more than three months from the arrival date;
     - An interline ticket (connecting ticket) with the confirmed departure date and seat number leaving for a third country or region within 144 hours; 
   - Visa-free entry ports applicable for this event:
     - Individuals who meet the above conditions may enter China visa-free through any of the three ports: Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, Shenzhen Airport, Jieyang Chaoshan Airport, and may depart from any of the 32 open international passenger ports in Guangdong Province. This policy allows for a 144-hour visa-free stay within the administrative region of Guangdong Province, covering major cities such as Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Zhuhai.
     - Note: The OSPO Summit is located within the aforementioned administrative region of Guangdong Province. Should you plan to visit other provinces or cities/regions beyond this area, such as Beijing, Shanghai, or Hangzhou, you will still be required to obtain a visa for China before entering the country.
