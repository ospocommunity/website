Apache Kyuubi(Incubating) is a big data gateway, which supports multi-tenant and distributed features, and can be suitable for enterprise applications in big data scenarios, such as ETL and BI reports. At present, the main direction is to build a Serverless SQL on Lakehouse service based on its own architecture design and all kinds of mainstream computing engines. Currently, the engines supported are Spark, Flink and Trino.

EBay software Engineer Fei Wang will introduce the architecture and key features of Apache Kyuubi, rich usage scenarios, and how eBay builds the Unified & ServerLess Spark Gateway based on Apache Kyuubi. And the latest features and roadMap for the Apache Kyuubi community.
