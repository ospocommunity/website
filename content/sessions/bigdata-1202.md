Spark on Kubernetes has gained more and more attention and usage. Due to the lack of Kubernetes' batch scheduling support, resource deadlocks often occur in big data scheduling scenarios. In addition, It lacks advanced capabilities such as queue, priority, resource reservation, and multiple computing force scheduling. This topic describes the latest developments and best practices of the Apache Spark community Support Customized Kubernetes Schedulers.

- Current status and challenges of Spark on Kubernetes
- Latest developments in the Spark community: Support Customized Kubernetes Schedulers
- Display Spark on Kubernetes scheduling capability through Volcano
- Demo: Demonstrates the overall functions of Spark + Volcano, including the queue, priority, resource reservation, and multiple computing force scheduling capabilities.
